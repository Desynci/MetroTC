# MetroTC #
Meet **MetroTC** - universal textures converter for all Metro games.
Simply select a folder with game textures, or select a single texture and click **Convert!**
Now sit back and relax while all your textures are being properly transcoded to a standard DDS.

Main features:
1) Supports all Metro games and their versions
2) Assembles 512/1024/2048 parts into one proper DDS with mipmaps
3) The tool can detect that texture was already converted and will skip it, so it's safe go give it a partically converted folder ;)
